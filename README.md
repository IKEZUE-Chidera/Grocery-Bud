### **List Management Project Overview**

In this project, we'll build a list management application that utilizes **local storage** to save user-added items. This allows users to return to the application and see the items they previously added.

### **Key Features**:

1. **Local Storage**:
   - Each time the user adds an item, it gets saved in local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
   - When the user returns, the application displays all previously added items.

2. **Item Management**:
   - Users can **remove all items** from the list if desired.
   - The application supports **editing items**. When an item is edited:
     - It remains in the same position in the list.
     - The submit button's value changes to reflect that the user is editing an existing item rather than adding a new one.
     - The edited value replaces the original item in the list.
       
This project emphasizes practical coding skills for managing dynamic content in web applications and effectively using local storage for user data retention.
